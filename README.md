Enter a sequence: 3 2 5 1 4

In-order traversal of BST: 1 2 3 4 5

Number of sequences: 6

1. sequence: 3 2 5 1 4
2. sequence: 3 2 5 4 1
3. sequence: 3 2 1 5 4
4. sequence: 3 5 2 4 1
5. sequence: 3 5 2 1 4
6. sequence: 3 5 4 2 1
 
--------------------------------
In my solution, I used a linked list structure to store both the input and output sequences. I implemented insert, delete, clone and print functions for this linked list. After reading input and constructing the linked list, keys are inserted to BST with a simple recursive insert algorithm.  In order to verify BST is constructed correctly, a function is called to print the in-order traversal of the BST.

To find all the sequences, I implemented a recursive function. Function starts with the root of the tree:
- Add the node to main sequence
- Add the left and right nodes to possible choices
- For each possible choice, remove from possible choices, reinvoke the function with the node
- When there are no possible choices left, add the main sequence to the list of sequences. 
- Recursion ends when there are no possible choices left

I defined a dynamically growing array type to store all the sequences. This array stores the head pointers of the linked lists (sequences). When it runs out of memory, it wil reallocate 2 times of itâ€™s size. Finally, this array type is traversed and sequences are printed to the console. If there are more than 50 sequences, only first 50 sequences will be printed.
